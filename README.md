**DATA COLLECTION:**

Collected data from University of Maryland’s sports website having information about the schedule of matches which were played from the year 2000 to 2023.

**Data Source:**

Selected text only in order to view the data in table format-
 
We considered all the important rows such as date of match, location of match, opponent details and the final match result. Analyzed the data on MS Word and MS excel and then formed the mission statement and mission objectives accordingly.

We identified Entities, Relations, Primary and Foreign keys using which we made our ER diagram and Relational schema.

**MISSION STATEMENT:**
 
As consultants, our mission is to serve as the catalyst for the University of Maryland women’s softball team's transformation, to equip the team with actionable recommendations, enabling them to elevate performance standards and establish a legacy of sporting achievement.

**MISSION OBJECTIVES:**
 
●  	OBJECTIVE 1: Analyze the top 10 teams where Maryland has lost against the maximum number of times

●  	OBJECTIVE 2: Analyze the top 10 away locations where Maryland has won the most number of times

●  	OBJECTIVE 3: Analyze the top 10 matches where Maryland has won with a shutout

●  	OBJECTIVE 4: Analyze the top 10 of teams against which Maryland has won the maximum number of times

●  	OBJECTIVE 5:  Analyze the top 10 teams against whom Maryland has won by the highest margin

**ANALYSIS:**
● Conducted detailed SQL queries to identify KPIs for the softball team, enhancing strategic analysis 

● Utilized tableau to create advanced visualizations

**INSIGHTS:**

●	Number of “Shutouts” indicate impressive defensive play from the team, as it reflects a strong performance in preventing the opposing team's hitters from reaching home plate. It signifies effective pitching, solid fielding, and teamwork to keep the opponent from scoring. Maryland’s team showed impressive defensive play against George Washington 8 times, Georgetown 7 times etc.

●	In contrast, Maryland’s defeat with the highest margins against teams like Nebraska, Ohio State, Clemson etc. show where their pitching, fielding and overall defense was weak. They should focus on defensive aspects of their game against these opponents.

●	Maryland has dominated the most against teams like Virginia, Delaware State, Towson etc. They should be confident when playing against these teams.

●	The maximum number of defeats against teams like Georgia Tech, Florida State, North Carolina etc. shed light on whom Maryland should practice more, get more fan support and improve their overall performance.
